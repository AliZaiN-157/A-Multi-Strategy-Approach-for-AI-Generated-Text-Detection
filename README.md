## üìñ Overview

The proliferation of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) has made the detection of AI-generated text a critical area of research. This project addresses this challenge by developing and evaluating three distinct systems for the M-DAIGT shared task, which includes:
*   **Subtask 1:** Detecting AI-generated text in **News Articles**.
*   **Subtask 2:** Detecting AI-generated text in **Academic Abstracts**.

Our primary submission, a fine-tuned RoBERTa-base model, demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving near-perfect scores on both subtasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architectures

We developed three systems, each employing a different strategy for text detection.

### 1. RoBERTa-based Classifier (Primary Submission)
A fine-tuned `roberta-base` model. The input text is tokenized, and the final hidden state of the `[CLS]` token is passed through a linear layer for binary classification. This model proved to be the most effective and was our final submission for both subtasks.

### 2. TF-IDF + SVM Classifier
A traditional machine learning pipeline that serves as a strong baseline. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to vectorize text into n-gram features (n=2, 3), which are then classified by a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).

### 3. Candace: Llama-Feature Ensemble
An experimental system that extracts probabilistic features from a suite of Llama-3.2 models (1B & 3B, base & instruct variants). These features (log-probabilities, entropy) are then fed into a custom Transformer Encoder-based classifier for the final prediction.

## üìä Results

Our systems were evaluated on the official M-DAIGT test set. The RoBERTa-based system demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving perfect or near-perfect scores across all metrics.

| System | Subtask (Domain) | Accuracy | F1-Score | Precision | Recall |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **RoBERTa-base (System 1)** | **News (Subtask 1)** | **99.99%** | **99.99%** | **99.80%** | **100.00%** |
| **RoBERTa-base (System 1)** | **Academic (Subtask 2)** | **100.00%** | **100.00%** | **100.00%** | **100.00%** |
| TF-IDF + SVM (System 2) | News (Subtask 1) | 97.90% | 97.91% | 97.52% | 98.30% |
| TF-IDF + SVM (System 2) | Academic (Subtask 2) | 99.85% | 99.85% | 100.00% | 99.70% |
| Candace (System 3) | News (Subtask 1) | 99.75% | 99.75% | 99.60% | 99.90% |
| Candace (System 3) | Academic (Subtask 2) | 99.95% | 99.95% | 100.00% | 99.90% |
